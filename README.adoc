## jboss-module

These instructions are untested but should work none the less.
jla_01-1.0.5-jboss-modules.jar contains logback appender for jboss as jboss-module. For generic information about jboss modules, see https://jboss-modules.github.io/jboss-modules/manual/

### Inclusion

Copy the jar into $EAP_HOME/modules.

Include module by using following convetion to target module.xml (which may be quite many).
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<module ...>
<.../>
<dependencies>
<module name="com.teragrep.jla_01"/>
</dependencies>
<.../>
</module>
```

One may wish to add this as a global module according to following link in order to avoid multiple inclusions:
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_enterprise_application_platform/7.0/html-single/configuration_guide/index#add_a_global_module


## Configuring pre-built Logback application

First download wanted versions of jla_01, rlp_01 and syslog-java-client from the following urls:

https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.teragrep/jla_01[jla_01]

https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.teragrep/rlp_01[rlp_01]

https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.cloudbees/syslog-java-client[syslog-java-client]

Then run java while pointing classpath to the directory where you downloaded the jars to like:

```
java -cp "path/to/downloaded/jars/*:target/example.jar" com.teragrep.example.Main
```
